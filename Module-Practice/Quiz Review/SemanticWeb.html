    <h2>WINDSONG</h2>
        <p>
            Countless pioneers plunge headlong into various domains: computer science, emerging industries, Dadaism, and many others. Eager to spread their inspiration far and wide,
            these innovators paint every corner of the globe with their ideas. Archaeologists are no exception.
             Watkins, curious about these orderly, indescribable lines, called them "ley lines." 
             Though he had few followers and faced much skepticism, his theory began its journey, albeit a rocky one.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through "cultural transmission," this fledgling theory was spread around the world. 
            It appeared in the newsletters of exclusive societies, was discussed
            in archaeological and geographical publications, and eventually found 
            its way into university classrooms, where it was given a more formal title: the study of ley lines.

<h2>
    LIST OF WINDSONG's BELONGINGS
</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Cheap Tie</strong>: The exact number shows how distinct this accessory is. "This is an essential investment, especially when you're trying to convince others of the importance of your project.</li>
    <li><strong>Range Finder</strong>: A tool often used by humans in geophysical prospecting, yet imbued with unmistakable arcane modifications. The interviewee demonstrated its paramount importance in the study of ley linesâ€”presenting it as a symbol of the arcanum's interdisciplinarity.</li>
    <li><strong>The Study of Ley Lines</strong>: These delicate papers hold the remnants of a once-thriving academic field. We are lucky to catch a glimpse of their forgotten knowledge by the faint glow of an oil lamp in a small, dusty chamber.</li>

    <h2>Analysis Paralysis</h2>
    <p>Marcus reads everything, from the ingredients on product labels to the changing expressions of important figures. 
        However, the sheer breadth of information that her keen eyes observe brings her considerable trouble. 
        She frequently finds herself caught in a dilemma of "this makes sense, but so does that, often overthinking to the point of immobility. 
        The information she absorbs does not aid her decision-making; in fact, it hinders her.</p>
</article>

<article>
<h2>Record Everything</h2>
<p>
    Before joining the Foundation, Marcus had spent a long time stationed in the Flannan Isles. She was captivated by the mysterious incidents 
    that occurred there and resolved to record every one of them, from the pervasive sea fog to the twisted reefs, the eternally operating lighthouse, 
    and the disappearing people. She had to capture every detail. They were all just too significant to be discarded. Ultimately,
     Marcus wrote it all down, producing an extensive and detailed manuscript. She showed the people what she saw, eagerly anticipating their reactions.

    <h2>Her Path</h2>
    <p>
        After writing History of the Flannan Isles, Marcus followed Hofmann to the Foundation. With her mentor's help, she no longer had to bear the burden of making decisions alone, nor did she need to handle complex interpersonal relationships. Hofmann turned the pages of the world for her; all she had to do was concentrate on what she did best-reading.
But as the curtain fell over Vienna, she could no longer turn the pages of that burning old book. Now, she must once again read this complex, terrifying, and beautiful world alone.
The path before her is the only one left. It is solitary, long, and arduous.
<b><i>But she will keep moving forward.</b></i>

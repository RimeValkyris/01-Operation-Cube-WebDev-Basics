3.2.2 The <a> Tag and the href Attribute

The <a> tag primarily relies on the href attribute, which specifies the destination of the link.

<a href="https://www.example.com/">Visit our website</a>

3.2.3 Internal Links
There are two types of hyperlinks: internal and external. 
Internal links are used to navigate within the same website or web page
External links are used to navigate to other websites or web pages

<a href="https://example.com/page.html">Link to Page</a> – the full address of the page (absolute URL).

<a href="/page.html">Link to Page</a> – the relative URL which only includes the path to the page, 
and creates a link to the page.html file in the same directory as the current page.

3.2.5 External Links
To create an external link, you need to specify the full URL of the page, website, or resource that you want to link to. For example:
<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example.com</a>

3.2.7 Other Link-Specific Attributes: download, rel, and title
The download Attribute
The download attribute specifies that the target of the link should be downloaded rather than navigated to. 
The attribute value can be used as the default filename that the downloaded file will be saved as.

<a href="https://example.com/document.pdf" download="my-document.pdf">Download my document</a>

The rel Attribute
The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the target document. 
It can be used to indicate that the target document is a stylesheet, a parent document, or a part of a series, among other things.

For example:
<a href="https://example.com/stylesheet.css" rel="stylesheet">Link to stylesheet</a>


The title Attribute
The title attribute provides additional information about an element, enhancing the user's understanding and interaction with web content.

<p>Go to <a href="https://example.com/about" title="Visit our About section.">our website</a> for more information.</p>

3.2.8 Turning Elements into Links
To make an element clickable, you simply need to wrap the <a> tag around it. 
    The href attribute within this tag defines the URL to which the link points.

<a href="https://www.example.com">
    <img src="/uploads/media/default/0001/03/mountain_landscape.jpg" alt="Mountain landscape" width="340" height="250">
</a>


3.3.1 Video and Audio Elements
Media content such as video and audio can greatly enhance a website's user experience.
For example, the following code embeds a video with built-in 
media controls and automatic playback when the page loads:

<video src="myvideo.mp4" controls autoplay>
   Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

        <!--THIS IS THE SUMMARY OF THE WEB UP TO MODERN DAY I USED THE
        BIGGEST HEADER HERE and Aligned the header to the Center-->
        <h1 align="center">THE WEB THROUGH TIME</h1>
        <p>Web 1.0 is the very start of the Web it is only a read type website in which libraries are not yet invented. This is mainly used by
            Companies to introduce themselves and it only uses basic HTML and CSS. Web 2.0 introduces the use of libaries. This is still used in today's times such as Next.js to make it more presentable.
            and lastly Web 3.0 introduces block-chain, NFTs or (Non Fungible Token) to make the Website more modernize.

        <h2>WEB 2.0</h2>
        <p>Web 2.0 is still <span style="color: red;">used in the modern times due to libaries</span></p>
        <p>Web 2.0 is not like Web 1.0, because <i><b><span style="color: blue;">Web 1.0 only uses basic HTML and CSS usage.</span></b></i> Unlike Web 2.0, it uses libraries and Javascript to make the website more responsive</p>
   
        <!--In here, I described the difference of static and Dynamic Webiste I used H2 as a title, and I used an Ordered List to differentiate it-->
    <hr>
    <h2>Difference of Static and Dynamic Website</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>A Static Website doesnt use a database to retrieve data but a Dynamic website use one.</li>
        <li>A Dymanic Website uses more complex back-end features like Node.js, rather than a Static Web</li>
        <li>A Dynamic webiste uses a server to load the contents of the website which is faster but the static website uses the client side in which there will be some problems loading it</li>
    </ol>

<!--in here, I presented the different types of Web pages using unordered list-->
    <h2>Different types of Websites</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>E-Porfolio</li>
        <li>Blog Website</li>
        <li>Home Page</li>
    </ul>
<!--in here, I used Nested List starting with E-Commerce and used Unordered list to present it's contents-->
    <h2>Nested List</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>E-Commerce
            <ul>
                <li>Products</li>
                <li>Shopping Cart</li>
